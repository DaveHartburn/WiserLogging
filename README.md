# WiserLogging
Log temperatures and events from a Drayton Wiser home heating system

Objectives
  *  Obtain a list of room temperatures and graph via ThingsBoard
  *  Report individual battery levels and graph them
  *  Report when each radiator requests heat and opens the valve
  *  Report when the boiler fires up
  *  When do radiators go into eco mode / open windows detected?
  *  Set up timed automations, e.g. Away mode for 4 hours
  *  Advanced control of one radiator valve which doesnâ€™t seem to turn one radiator off
  *  Essentially produce a log of day to day activities
